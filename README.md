# hosts

The `hosts` CLI tool generates a DNS sinkhole configuration ready to be imported in an [unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) instance.  
It retrieves data from curated {black,white}lists - see [sources](sources.json).

*NB*: unbound's setup is **not** covered here.

# Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/da-rod/hosts
```

# Usage

```bash
$ hosts -h
Usage of ~/go/bin/hosts:
  -output string
        output file name (default "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/blacklist.conf")
  -sources string
        file containing the sources to retrieve the lists (default "$GOPATH/src/github.com/da-rod/hosts/sources.json")
```

# Systemd

For an automated setup, you can add it to systemd so that:
1. the blacklist is updated periodically
2. it gets reloaded by unbound

In order to achieve this, follow these steps:

```bash
$ sudo mv systemd/* /etc/systemd/system/
# Make sure that the path to the binary is correct in the service file...
$ sudo systemctl enable unbound-blacklist.timer
$ sudo systemctl start unbound-blacklist.timer

# Verify:
$ awk '/zone/ {print$2}' /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/blacklist.conf | shuf -n1 | xargs dig +short
0.0.0.0     # yay!!
```
