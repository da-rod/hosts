# hosts

The `hosts` CLI tool generates a DNS sinkhole configuration ready to be imported in an [unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) instance.  
It retrieves data from curated {block,safe}lists - see [sources](sources.json).

*NB*: unbound's setup is **not** covered here.

# Installation

```bash
$ go install github.com/da-rod/hosts@latest
```

# Usage

```bash
$ hosts -h
Usage of ~/go/bin/hosts:
  -output string
        output file name (default "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/blocklist.conf")
  -sources string
        file containing the sources to retrieve the lists (default "$GOPATH/src/github.com/da-rod/hosts/sources.json")
```

# Docker

Use the image from Docker Hub:
```bash
$ docker run -d --name unbound-blockhole -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp peper/unbound-blockhole
```

Or build your own image:
```bash
$ docker build -t unbound-blockhole .
```

# Systemd

For an automated setup, you can add it to systemd so that:
1. the blocklist is updated periodically
2. it gets reloaded by unbound

In order to achieve this, follow these steps:

```bash
$ sudo mv systemd/* /etc/systemd/system/
# Make sure that the path to the binary is correct in the service file...
$ sudo systemctl enable unbound-blocklist.timer
$ sudo systemctl start unbound-blocklist.timer

# Verify:
$ awk '/zone/ {print$2}' /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/blocklist.conf | shuf -n1 | xargs dig +short
0.0.0.0     # yay!!
```
